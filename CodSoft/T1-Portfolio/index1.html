                <h1 class="headings"> Quora Clone </h1>
                <p>In our 5th semester , I made a group projects in which we made quora clone using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Our clone was Responsive. I made the posts section in Home page and Following page. I divided the various sections in my work into "div" . 
                    This made it easy to style my part using CSS. The color theme was same as that of original quora because we wanted to preserve the originality of the actual Quora. The red and white theme in Quora is its signature mark.

                <p>During the 1st Sem of our BE degree, we're asked to make a website as a group project. We made a website displaying a few unique restaurants from all over India. We were four members so we divided the task among ourselves in which I was assigned the html part of all the pages in our project. I collected all the content 
                for our website along with one more team member and gave structure to our website. In our project , I use div tags and gave classes and id to them so that it would be convenient for other members to style the website.</p>
